# Decentralized Healthcare Clinical Trial Management

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain-based solution for managing clinical trials in healthcare. By utilizing smart contracts on a decentralized network, the system enhances transparency, security, and integrity throughout the clinical trial process while protecting patient privacy and ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Key Components

### Research Institution Verification Contract
- Validates and registers legitimate research organizations and sponsors
- Maintains cryptographic proof of institutional credentials and certifications
- Implements governance protocols for adding/removing verified institutions
- Links institutions to their approved protocols and studies
- Stores regulatory compliance documentation and audit histories

### Protocol Registration Contract
- Records approved study methodologies and trial designs
- Maintains immutable versions of clinical trial protocols
- Captures regulatory approvals and ethics committee authorizations
- Implements protocol amendment tracking with version control
- Provides public verification of pre-registered outcomes and methods

### Patient Enrollment Contract
- Manages participant consent and eligibility verification
- Implements privacy-preserving participant identification
- Records enrollment status and randomization assignments
- Tracks patient withdrawal and protocol deviations
- Ensures proper informed consent documentation and updates

### Data Collection Contract
- Securely stores trial results and clinical observations
- Implements data access controls and privacy safeguards
- Provides cryptographic proof of data integrity and timestamps
- Enables selective disclosure mechanisms for different stakeholders
- Supports data verification without compromising patient privacy

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- Web3 provider (Infura, Alchemy, etc.)
- Ethereum-compatible wallet
- IPFS node (for decentralized storage)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-clinical-trials.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd decentralized-clinical-trials

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx truffle compile

# Run tests
npx truffle test

# Deploy to test network
npx truffle migrate --network rinkeby
```

## Usage

The platform serves multiple stakeholders in the clinical trial ecosystem:

### For Research Institutions & Sponsors
- Register institutional identity and credentials
- Create and register clinical trial protocols
- Monitor enrollment progress and data collection
- Access aggregated trial results with appropriate permissions

### For Clinical Investigators
- Link to verified research institutions
- Enroll eligible patients with proper consent
- Record clinical observations and outcomes
- Submit adverse event reports securely

### For Patients/Participants
- Provide digitally signed informed consent
- Control access to personal health information
- Verify participation in specific trials
- Access personal trial data and study results

### For Regulators & Auditors
- Verify protocol registration and amendments
- Review consent procedures and participant protections
- Audit data collection processes
- Access compliance documentation and trial records

## Security Considerations

- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
- Homomorphic encryption for sensitive health data
- Role-based access control with multi-factor authentication
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- HIPAA and GDPR compliance mechanisms
